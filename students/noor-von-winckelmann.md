"Light. The first thing you see when you are born, the source of life. It is a fascinating phenomenon that forms the basis of my work. Light has an incredible beauty in it, but it is so natural that it often goes unnoticed. As an artist, I am inspired by light reflections, refractions and shadows that guide my work." 

  

\- Noor von Winckelmann °2000

Noor von Winckelmann is a twenty year old artist who studies printmaking. Her work revolves around light. Using the medium of printmaking, she translates this abstract and changeable manifestation onto paper. She transforms the flat aspect of printmaking into a more object-like interpretation by changing the form of presentation. In the work for this exhibition she chose a less literal translation of light. She presents 3 objects, each of which is a different form of the prism. The dispersive prism, the pentaprism and the dove prism. The prism is a tool to deflect and refract a beam of light shining through this optical element. Each side of the object consists of an abstracted collograph inspired by the polarization of light and its elusive, arbitrary shape. The iridescent film covering the objects represents the changing color. Each side is printed and combined with a colored film. The color spectrum of light is an important factor that Noor blends into her work. 



It is a changing and infinite quest in which she tries to project her personal vision on the concept of light. She does this by not trying to reproduce the incredible beauty of light, because it cannot be matched, but by capturing it within printmaking in her own way. Telling a story of light.
