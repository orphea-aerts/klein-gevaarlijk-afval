Yasmine Akondo (°2000)  Arendonk/Antwerp

In her work, she is looking for a beacon of peace in our hectic lives where we often forget that our existence is the only thing that really matters.  All our political, economic, educational, ... systems are just imposed structures that are no necessities to live. Therefor she tries to return to the essence of life, to rest and meditation, the earthly and the heavenly and studies  this in various cultures. In this upcoming expo she will translate this in a trip teak of movement, sound and matter.

![The amorphous human being   shows my personal visual translation on the absolute, reduced form of being and existence. It is the core of our entity. It is our raw form, untouched by influences of our created world (with that I mean: outside influences, created by an imposed structure. i.e. The unnatural.)  This core is cast in bronze, which gives value to the amorphous human being, to our soul, our basis of existence. This purest form, regardless of our physical death, will always exist.  By making it no larger than a middle finger, it is the perfect talisman as a precious relic that we can always carry with us, so that we may remember to remain faithful to our true selves, and remember that our current state of being is just ephemeral.](/images/dsc06960-3-.jpg "The amorphous human being")
