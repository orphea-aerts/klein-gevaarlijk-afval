      ‘Klein Gevaarlijk Afval‘ is the result of a
year long exhibition project, organized
and conceived by 20 young artists who
will graduate with a bachelor in Fine
Arts at Sint Lucas Antwerpen.
The show contextualizes the process
of exhibition making and questions
the ecological impact of an artistic
practice in a humoristic an relevant
way by alluding to the architecture of
container parks which is the destination
for artistic residual materials. The
participants of the show also highlight
their place in society - young,
idealistic, and powerful individuals.
By showcasing their works amongst
the endpoint for many of the material,
they show that they can be in control
of their destiny by questioning their
participation in a cycle of consuming
and producing waste and perhaps
come up with new and better ideas to
work as an artist in this new age.
I would like to thank all the students for
their work and strength to realize this
project and wish them the very best for
all their future endeavors.
